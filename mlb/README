These files create tables in Yahoo's new YQL to allow you to query part of MLB Gameday's massive Pitchf/x database. MLB makes this data freely available, but no API is provided. These tables form an easily-queriable interface to MLB's data.

If you're logged into Yahoo, you can try em out by loading up the YQL console with the mlb.gd2.env file:
