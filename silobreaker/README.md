## TODO
- make types batchable

## Notes
- /documetns max pagesize is 250 (not documented)
- /topStories - "noStories" max seems to be 50 (not documented)
- /entityGraph - "noNodes" max seems to be 100 (not documented)
- /documents - "types" seems not to work
- "type" is not a good parameter name. Should be called "format" instead
- /topStories "Extras" should really be "extras"
